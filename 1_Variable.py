"""
Variable:
Variables is like a container that hold's data

Variable Names:
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).


Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Example
# Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"


"""
Example
Illegal variable names:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
"""


# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"


# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"


# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"


# this is integer type data
a=12  
# We  can Print the type of any operator using type Function
print(type(a))    


# this is String value
b="Hello World"  
print(type(b))


# This is a Boolean Value
c=True   
print(type(c))


 # This is a None value
d=None   
print(type(d))
